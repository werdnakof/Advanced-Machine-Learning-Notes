## Decision Tree
**Removing Variance By Averaging**
- We can reduce the variance and improve our generalisation error by averaging over different models
- A number of different techniques for doing this that go by the name of ensemble methods or ensemble learning
- This trick can be used with many different learning machines, but is clearly most practical for machine that can be trained quickly
- (nevertheless, even for deep learning taking the average response of many machines is usually done to win competitions)
