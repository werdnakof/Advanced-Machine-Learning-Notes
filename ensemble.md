## Decision Tree
**Removing Variance By Averaging**
- We can reduce the variance and improve our generalisation error by averaging over different models
- A number of different techniques for doing this that go by the name of ensemble methods or ensemble learning

Steps:
1. Decision trees build binary tree to partition the data $D = {(x, y)}$, into _leaves_.
2. Each decision rule depends on a single feature
3. At each step
